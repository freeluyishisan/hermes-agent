"""#40170: keep an echoed recall block out of stored turns.

A single scrub at the turn-finalize boundary strips the signed injected block
from the persisted assistant turn (and the in-memory state replayed next turn),
so the echoed-then-persisted class is closed in one place rather than at every
downstream consumer. A stray <memory-context> a user types is preserved.
