"""iron-proxy (`ironsh/iron-proxy`) integration for credential-injecting egress control.

Why
---

Remote terminal sandboxes (Docker, Modal, SSH) currently see real upstream
API credentials.  A prompt-injected agent inside one of these sandboxes can
``cat ~/.config/openrouter/auth.json`` or ``printenv | grep -i key`` and
exfiltrate them.

iron-proxy is a TLS-intercepting egress firewall (Apache-2.0, Go binary, by
ironsh).  It sits between the sandbox and the internet, enforces a default-deny
allowlist on outbound hosts, and *swaps proxy tokens for real credentials*
on the way out.  The sandbox only ever holds opaque proxy tokens — leaking
them is useless, since they only work behind the configured trusted proxy
boundary (the CA private key and proxy endpoint integrity are part of that
boundary: if traffic can be redirected to attacker-controlled proxy
infrastructure, the guarantee no longer holds).

Design summary
--------------

* The ``iron-proxy`` binary is auto-installed into ``<hermes_home>/bin/iron-proxy``
  on first use.  Hermes pins one upstream version (``_IRON_PROXY_VERSION``)
  and downloads the matching tar.gz from the official GitHub Releases page,
  verifying the SHA-256 against the release's ``checksums.txt``.

* A long-lived CA at ``<hermes_home>/proxy/ca.{crt,key}`` is generated on
  first ``hermes egress setup``.  Sandboxes trust this CA so iron-proxy can
  terminate TLS and rewrite headers.

* The proxy config lives at ``<hermes_home>/proxy/proxy.yaml``.  It enumerates
  the per-provider allowlists and the ``secrets`` transform that does the
  Authorization-header swap.

* Token mappings (proxy token -> real credential lookup) live alongside the
  config.  The real credential is **never** written to the config — iron-proxy
  reads it from its own environment via ``{type: env, var: NAME}``.  When
  Bitwarden Secrets Manager is configured, the real value is pulled there
  at proxy startup instead.

* The proxy runs as a managed subprocess (``hermes egress start``), pidfile
  at ``<hermes_home>/proxy/iron-proxy.pid``.  Daemon output (including
  per-request records on v0.39) goes to ``<hermes_home>/proxy/iron-proxy.log``;
  ``audit.log`` is pre-created but reserved for a future pin that supports
  ``log.audit_path``.

* Failures (binary missing, port collision, bad config) emit a one-line
  warning and do *not* block agent startup.  The Docker backend refuses to
  start a sandbox with the proxy enabled-but-down, with a clear error.

This module is intentionally subprocess-driven rather than depending on any
iron-proxy Python bindings — a single cross-platform binary is easier to
lazy-install than a wheels-with-extension dependency, and we keep maintenance
to a "bump the pinned version" loop.

      fall back to loopback — there are no sandboxes to serve in that

    * **macOS / Windows Docker Desktop:** ``host.docker.internal``
      resolves via VPNkit to the host, so a loopback bind is reachable

    the sandbox never sees them.

      CONNECT tunnel.  We point it at loopback so it doesn't conflict with
      anything else and disable the listener.
    * The ``proxy.tunnel_listen`` is what sandboxes hit via ``HTTPS_PROXY``.
      ``http_listen`` / ``https_listen`` are present (loopback only) so the
      proxy boots; sandboxes never route directly to them.
    * ``allowlist`` transform takes ``domains:`` and ``cidrs:``, not ``hosts:``.
    * ``secrets`` transform takes ``secrets:`` (plural), each with a
      ``source``, a ``replace.proxy_value`` (the sandbox-visible token), and
      a list of ``rules`` saying which hosts the swap should fire on.

    # Both get the sandbox-facing bind host: tunnel on ``tunnel_port``,
    # plain HTTP on ``tunnel_port + 1``.
